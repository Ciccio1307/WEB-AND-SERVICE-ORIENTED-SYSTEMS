# WEB-AND-SERVICE-ORIENTED-SYSTEMS

This repository provides resources and examples for understanding the basic conceptual foundations and operational capabilities required to develop web and distributed applications. It explores typical architectural solutions and development technologies to build robust and efficient systems.

## Key Concepts and Architectures

The course focuses on the following architectural paradigms and design patterns:

- **Client-Server Paradigm**: A distributed application structure that separates tasks between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients).
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)**: A communication method enabling the execution of procedures on a remote server.
- **Dynamic Web Applications**: Applications where content and user interactions are dynamically generated on the server or client side.
- **HTTP Request Handlers (Servlets)**: Server-side programs to process client requests and generate dynamic responses.
- **MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)**: A design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components to facilitate code reuse and parallel development.
- **REST APIs**: A web service design model using stateless communication and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

## Technologies Covered

The development technologies and tools demonstrated in this repository include:

1. **C/Unix**: For foundational understanding of network programming and low-level operations.
2. **Java**: For robust object-oriented programming and server-side development.
3. **PHP**: For dynamic web applications and lightweight server-side scripting.
4. **Frameworks**: Accompanying frameworks for Java and PHP to demonstrate advanced application development patterns.
